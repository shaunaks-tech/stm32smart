# 🕶️ STM32F411 Voice-Controlled Smartglasses (WIP)

This project aims to build **embedded smartglasses powered by an STM32F411 (Blackpill)** that can recognize voice commands, provide haptic/LED feedback, and communicate with a smartphone over Bluetooth.

The project is developed using **CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard)** directly — avoiding HAL for full control, better performance, and lower memory usage. Initial tests verify GPIO output (e.g., blinking the onboard LED on PC13) and proper clock configuration using only register-level code.

## Project Goals

- **Voice Command Recognition** (TinyML, TensorFlow Lite Micro)
- **Microphone Audio Capture** (INMP441 via I2S + DMA)
- **Bluetooth Communication** (HC-05 / BLE UART to phone)
- **Haptic/LED Feedback System**
- **Battery-Powered Operation with Power Optimization**
- Optional: GPS-assisted navigation via phone app

##  Current Status

| Component         | Status     |
|------------------|------------|
| CMSIS Setup       |  Working |
| Clock Config (84 MHz via HSE + PLL) |  Working |
| GPIO Control      | Blinking PC13 |
| Voice Pipeline    | 🔜 Planned |
| I2S Mic + DMA     | 🔜 Planned |
| BLE UART          | 🔜 Planned |
| ML Inference      | 🔜 Planned |

## 🛠️ Framework

The project is built using:

- **CMSIS (no STM32 HAL)**
- **PlatformIO** with `framework = cmsis`
- Direct register-level control for:
  - Clock setup
  - GPIO initialization
  - Future peripherals (I2S, UART, DMA)

This approach provides:
- Lower memory footprint
- Higher execution speed
- Greater flexibility and insight into hardware behavior
