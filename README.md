# üï∂Ô∏è STM32F411 Voice-Controlled Smartglasses (WIP)

This project aims to build **embedded smartglasses powered by an STM32F411 (Blackpill)** that can recognize voice commands, provide haptic/LED feedback, and communicate with a smartphone over Bluetooth.

The project is developed using **CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard)** directly ‚Äî avoiding HAL for full control, better performance, and lower memory usage. Initial tests verify GPIO output (e.g., blinking the onboard LED on PC13) and proper clock configuration using only register-level code.

## Project Goals

- **Voice Command Recognition** (TinyML, TensorFlow Lite Micro)
- **Microphone Audio Capture** (INMP441 via I2S + DMA)
- **Bluetooth Communication** (HC-05 / BLE UART to phone)
- **Haptic/LED Feedback System**
- **Battery-Powered Operation with Power Optimization**
- Optional: GPS-assisted navigation via phone app

##  Current Status

| Component         | Status     |
|------------------|------------|
| CMSIS Setup       |  Working |
| Clock Config (84 MHz via HSE + PLL) |  Working |
| GPIO Control      | Blinking PC13 |
| Voice Pipeline    | üîú Planned |
| I2S Mic + DMA     | üîú Planned |
| BLE UART          | üîú Planned |
| ML Inference      | üîú Planned |

## üõ†Ô∏è Framework

The project is built using:

- **CMSIS (no STM32 HAL)**
- **PlatformIO** with `framework = cmsis`
- Direct register-level control for:
  - Clock setup
  - GPIO initialization
  - Future peripherals (I2S, UART, DMA)

This approach provides:
- Lower memory footprint
- Higher execution speed
- Greater flexibility and insight into hardware behavior
