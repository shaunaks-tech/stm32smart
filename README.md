# üï∂Ô∏è STM32F411 Gesture-Controlled Smartglasses (WIP)

This project aims to build **embedded smartglasses powered by an STM32F411 (Blackpill)** that can recognize hand or head gestures using an **MPU6050 accelerometer + gyroscope sensor**, provide haptic/LED feedback, and communicate with a smartphone over Bluetooth.

The system will run **TinyML (TensorFlow Lite Micro)** models directly on the MCU for real-time gesture classification.  
The project is developed using **CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard)** directly ‚Äî avoiding HAL for full control, better performance, and lower memory usage. Initial tests verify GPIO output (e.g., blinking PC13) and proper clock configuration using only register-level code.

## Project Goals

- **Gesture Recognition** (MPU6050 + TinyML inference)
- **MPU6050 Sensor Data Capture** (I2C interface)
- **Bluetooth Communication** (HC-05 / BLE UART to phone)
- **Haptic/LED Feedback System**
- **Battery-Powered Operation with Power Optimization**
- Optional: Extend to other sensors (e.g., touch, light)

## üõ†Ô∏è Framework

The project is built using:

- **CMSIS (no STM32 HAL)**
- **PlatformIO** with `framework = cmsis`
- Direct register-level control for:
  - Clock setup
  - GPIO initialization
  - I2C + MPU6050 interface
  - UART + BLE communication

This approach provides:
- Lower memory footprint
- Higher execution speed
- Greater flexibility and insight into hardware behavior
